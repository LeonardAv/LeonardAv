### 🔭 I’m currently working on
- my master’s thesis (Robust long-term growth rate of expected utility and optimal leverage for LETFs)
- Python tools for simulation, optimization, and visualization of leverage strategies

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- advanced stochastic modeling and numerical methods  
- robust portfolio/utility approaches under model uncertainty  
- best practices for clean, reproducible scientific code

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- quantitative finance projects (backtesting, portfolio optimization, risk engines)  
- research/code around stochastic volatility & jump models  
- open-source tools for education and research

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- performance optimization for large-scale simulations  

### 💬 Ask me about
- robust vs. nominal optimal strategies  
- volatility models
- Python for finance
- mathematical modeling
